# JEDI FUGITIVE: ECHOES OF THE FALLEN
## Game Summary & What to Expect

---

## 📖 Story

You are a Jedi Padawan on a covert reconnaissance mission to a remote Sith-controlled world. Your ship has been shot down by orbital defenses, crash-landing in hostile territory surrounded by ancient Sith tombs and ruins.

**The Situation:**
- Your comms are dead - no way to call for help
- Sith forces patrol the crash site  
- Ancient tombs dot the landscape, pulsing with dark energy
- The Sith have stolen 3 precious Jedi artifacts and hidden them deep within their most dangerous tombs, using them as focal points to corrupt the planet

**Your Mission:**
Infiltrate the Sith tombs, recover the 3 stolen Jedi artifacts, and use them to power your ship's communications array. But there's a catch - the artifacts have been corrupted by dark side rituals. The deeper you delve into the tombs, the more the darkness will test your resolve.

**The Question:**
Will you remain true to the Jedi Code, or will the seductive power of the Dark Side claim another fallen apprentice?
