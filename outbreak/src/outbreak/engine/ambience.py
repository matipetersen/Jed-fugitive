"""The world makes noise too: weather, loud ground, and things that go off on their own.

Everything here only *emits* noise or scales how far noise and sight carry; the zombies already know how to react to
both.  So a car alarm across town pulls the dead away from you, thunder pulls them toward wherever it struck, and
walking on gravel or through a market full of broken glass makes you far easier to find than walking on grass.
