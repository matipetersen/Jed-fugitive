"""The cipher: documents written in a code you learn word by word.

Unknown words show as glyphs.  Words are learned by *exposure* (seeing a word
again and again), by *study* (deliberately working at a document), and from
*teachers*.  Grammar words resolve once you are partly fluent; names once you
are very fluent, or once the document as a whole is decoded.  A decoded document
delivers its payload: a location, a vault code, a formula.
