"""One companion at a time: someone with a name, a strength, a flaw, a bond with you, and a death that sticks.

Anyone who is not hostile can become your companion (``recruit``).  The profile they get comes from who they are (a healer
is a medic) and from their id.  Strengths and flaws are small, regular effects applied from ``tick``; the bond between you
grows when you spend time together and win, and shrinks when you do things they cannot stand.  When the bond breaks they
leave; when they die, they stay dead, and the log says so.
